System logger performs _add description that only system and error logs_

Currently I want to store system logs inside local database (SQLite). Log records life time depends on several options:

 * *Store system log for specified number of sessions.*

 When bot is launched, we assume that new session is started. User can specify in [Config system configuration] how many sessions will be logged.

 * *Store system log records for specified time period*

 If bot is running permanently, user can specify interval of storing system logs. If log record will be older then logging interval it will be cleaned up automatically.

 * *Store only specified ammount of system log records*

 Only latest records will be present in system log. Total count of them is specified in system configuration _Link needed_

 * *Combination of all methods*

 System log cleans up old records and stores logs for only specified number of sessions. Additionally only specified number of system log records will be stored.

= Use-case =

_TODO: Add user case for all operations on syslog_

= Data model =

!LogRecord { id, timestamp, text, session_id }

Session { id, start_date, finish_date }
