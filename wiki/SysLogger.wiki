= Overview =

System logger performs logging of system events such as various errors, connection attempts and failures etc. It has nothing with group-chat / private-chat logging, though it may be used for logging system xmpp messages (e.g. error auth messages). 

System log can be configured through [BotConfig system configuration] 

System logs are stored inside local database (SQLite). Log records life time depends on several options:

 * *Store system log for specified number of sessions.*

 When bot is launched, we assume that new session is started. User can specify number of sessions to be logged in system configuration.

 * *Store system log records for specified time period*

 If bot is running permanently, user can specify interval of storing system logs. If log record will be older then logging interval it will be cleaned up automatically.

 * *Store only specified ammount of system log records*

 Only latest records will be present in system log. Total count of them is specified in system configuration _Link needed_

 * *Combination of all methods*

 System log cleans up old records and stores logs for only specified number of sessions. Additionally only specified number of system log records will be stored.
